This priject work aims to develop a program that simulates the operation of the processor and clearly shows how it works. We used 4 registers and 1 accumulator that had 12 bits. At the same time, the result of the command is entered into the accumulator, and data is entered into the registers, which can be either a literal in the command, or an address in memory, or a register. There was an integer addition command (in the complement code) for my varient. Also, each table should display PS - the status register, it can contain only the sign of the last result (for the first element "1" will be - , for "0" will be +), PC - command counter register and TC - clock counter register.
